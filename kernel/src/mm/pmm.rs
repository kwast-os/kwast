/// The default frame allocator.
///
/// How does this allocator work?
/// Instead of having a fixed area in the memory to keep the stack,
/// we let each free frame contain a pointer to the next free frame on the stack.
/// This limits the amount of virtual memory we need to reserve.
///
/// When we allocate a frame, we map it to the virtual memory and read the pointer.
/// Then we move the head. There is no unnecessary mapping happening here.
/// There is no additional mapping compared to the classical stack approach:
/// * When a page is being allocated it'll need to be mapped anyway.
/// * When a page is being freed it was already mapped.
///
/// It is likely that, for an allocation, the data will be accessed anyway after the mapping.
/// For a free, it is likely that the data was already accessed.
/// So that means there is likely no extra TLB miss or cache miss.
